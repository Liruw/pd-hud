## NP_HUD

This is a simple HUD script that I've built. It's a standalone plugin, so there is no requirements to run it.
There's room for improvements, such as voice range indicator, seatbelt, etc.

Thanks to [@Dullpear_dev](https://forum.fivem.net/u/Dullpear_dev) for improving the script performance :D
